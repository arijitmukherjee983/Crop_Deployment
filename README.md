# Crop Recommendation System

## Overview

The Crop Recommendation System is an advanced web-based platform designed to assist farmers and agricultural stakeholders by providing personalized crop recommendations based on soil and climate data. The system aims to optimize crop yields and promote sustainable farming practices. Users can input soil parameters (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH) and climate conditions (e.g., temperature, rainfall) to receive tailored crop suggestions. The platform also features a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement and provides contact information for agricultural experts.

## Features

- **Personalized Crop Recommendations**: Input soil and climate data to receive tailored crop suggestions.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Users can provide feedback to help improve the system.
- **Expert Contact Information**: Contact details for agricultural experts are available for user support.
